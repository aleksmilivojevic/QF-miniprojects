Four quantitative finance miniprojects, all in main.ipynb, as follows:

(1) We use current stock data to create two potentially profitable investment portfolios, one that is higher risk and one that is lower risk.

(2) We investigate the portfolios considered in miniproject 1 for evidence of normality, using the Shapiro-Wilk test on a sliding window of varying length, and discuss our findings. 

(3) We visualize and interpret the rate of change of the Black-Scholes call/put option price as time and spot price change. We plot and discuss call/put option prices as functions of time to expiry and spot price, together with call option delta and theta as functions of time to expiry and spot price.

(4) We explore the impact of a non-constant $\sigma$ on the distribution of profits of hedging, and explore a 
$\sigma$-hedging strategy and simulate its profit distribution. We compare a portfolio in which we delta hedge a short call position with underlying modelled by geometric Brownian motion (as in the Black-Scholes setup) to portfolios where we delta hedge and delta-vega hedge a short call position with underlying following a (finite-step, discrete) Heston model.
